=================

Finucane-Apputils: The Finucane Research Application Framework.

This framework is intended for application developers; specifically, developers
of tools with command-line interfaces. This framework can be used to create
applications with GUIs, but does not provide any direct support for such
endeavors, at this time. Support for **rapid**, consistent GUI development, a
"connected code" foundation, and much more, are on the roadmap for this project.

Tools created with this framework gain a consistent interface foundation. In
other words, this framework provides an abstract base for applications so that
a developer can leverage the well-known advantages of inheritance.
